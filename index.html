<h1>Victoria's Portfolio</h1>
<p>My name is Victoria and I am NYC born and raised. There is beauty to living in a city, both aesthetically and culturally, and I love finding ways to capture it. Another significant part of my identity is womanhood, and I like to explore how the complex relationships between women have shaped me.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have dipped my toes into different forms of media to explore and express my identity. My most recent exploration was filmmaking, which I got into as a way to combine my love for acting and short story writing.Writing is an outlet for me to document my truth and acting gives me the freedom to express it without fear of judgement. I have briefly given my hand at photography, but would love to explore it in more depth.</p>
