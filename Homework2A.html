<p>I chose to work with this image because I wanted to experiment with the colors, hue, and saturation. I was already a fan of the composition when I took this picture, but I thought some color would bring the staircase to life. To me, the before and after have two different visions: the original looking more bland and boring (appropriately, like a school or office space), and the photoshopped image looking more like a party scene with its vibrant colors.</p>
