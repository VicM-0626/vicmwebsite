<p>When I originally took the picture, the fire extinguisher was much more centered. I chose this picture to photoshop because I saw an opportunity to play around with composition and rule of thirds. When photoshopping the original image, I decided to recompose the fire extinguisher in a way that would draw the eye to one side of the image. Afterward, I started experimenting with some of the hues and saturation to make the fire extinguisher a new color.</p>
