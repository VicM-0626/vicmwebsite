<h1>In Plato's Cave</h1>
<p>	For me, photography is a way to capture memories. Time is the one resource that we can’t get back and I like that I can preserve the moments of life that I have lived. It is also reassuring to know that I will be able to preserve the life that I still have yet to live. Sure, I always have the option of telling stories with my words, but sometimes you need a visual representation of a specific moment in time to do a story justice.</p>
<p>As each day goes by, I realize more and more that I am living through a crucial point in time. As a college student in 2025, I am experiencing my early years of adulthood and I am becoming more conscious of the world around me. I have my own stories, but so does everyone else. One thousand people can experience the same exact event, yet somehow each individual person will still have their own account of it. On one hand, this can be a beautiful and fascinating thing, but on the other hand, it can become dangerous very fast. Words can be skewed, but so can images. Pictures tell stories, but not everyone will agree on what story a picture tells. This is when photography becomes weaponized.</p>
<p>In using photography to preserve memories, I also intend to use photography to express the things that I believe to be true. In the age of social media and a rapidly expanding digital world, it has become apparent that even the truth is subjective. The way I see it, there are three sides to the truth: the first is my own perspective, the second is someone else’s perspective, and the third is what really happened. I want to use photography to tell a story that is as close as possible to what really happened. Of course, it would be impossible for one single person to tell the whole truth, since perspective tends to taint credibility. However, I will educate myself on the prior and current circumstances that occur when I take a picture. This way, I will know how to frame my pictures in a way that will portray other perspectives in addition to my own.</p>
<p> The specific things that I choose to capture are crucial to consider when trying to visually represent the notions of our world at this moment in time. The current political climate is hot, so delicacy is key when it comes to capturing it. The key is to take multiple pictures, whether it’s from articles of varying sources to capture the stories on the news or various moments from a protest, in order to show multiple perspectives from people of this time. People will always have different perspectives on politics, but there’s something else we all experience yet have different takes on: pop culture! Whether it’s fashion choices or popular food, everyone has different tastes and experiences culture differently. Pop culture is my favorite aspect of life to capture and I would love to capture as much of it as possible, even the aspects I don't necessarily participate in myself. I enjoy capturing things like outfits I wear and festivals I attend, so I can capture these sorts of things from some friends that have different tastes than me because my experience of pop culture is not representative of everyone’s experience.</p>

<h1> AI Slop </h1>
<p>Going into this article, I assumed that the main argument was going to be something relating to the replacement of human art or actors. Looking back at the title (“distorting our reality”), I should have guessed that there was gonna be more to it. Nonetheless, it was still nice to see a different topic of conversation regarding the dangers of using Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>I hadn’t thought about AI being used as a propaganda tool, but after reading, I realized that I was already aware of some of the examples used in the article. I had seen the AI slop videos of white, blonde, sundown town-type families as well as some of the AI videos from the White House social media accounts. Regarding the White House, it’s interesting (in a more despairing way) to me what the White House considers acceptable when posting AI videos. When the White House uses AI to promote White Supremacy and to justify the violent ICE raids, they’re trying to “make America great again.” However, when the Chinese government posted AI videos mocking Americans in response to Trump’s tariffs, the White House called the videos “propaganda.” I believe that both examples demonstrate government propaganda and it isn’t fair to criticize these AI videos from one government while justifying another. The truth of the matter is, there is a specific audience that these AI propaganda videos are meant to reach and the people posting them know this.</p>
<p>The article also discusses more vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, watching these AI videos and spreading them to others. The elderly do not have the same sense of media literacy that people in my generation do, so it is easier for them to fall for AI-generated propaganda and deepfakes since they don’t often check their sources. I know this all too well having experienced it with other older family members. Although the elders in my family are not very tech savvy, I have relatives in their 50’s and 60’s that fall for AI slop. Usually it’s a more innocent mistake, such as posting AI animations they think are cute since they are unaware of AI’s effect on the climate and on human artists. However, this demographic of my family also tends to be very uninformed politically and will use Chat GPT to summarize articles for them. Using AI to summarize articles is harmful, since it is not always accurate. Additionally, it limits one’s ability to think for themselves, since they have the mindset that AI will understand difficult information for them. I try to tell them to evaluate their sources by reading different articles from other sources instead, but my attempts are futile since their critical thinking skills unfortunately aren’t there to begin with and they go back to asking AI to summarize anyway.</p>
<p>I might just be fortunate to be young during a time when the internet and social media are the way of life. I’ve been taught media literacy since middle school and am still learning it in college to this day. It becomes harder to learn things when you’re older, so I understand why it’s easier for older generations to fall for AI slop, since the internet came along later in their lives. It’s not impossible, however, to learn late in life. In my opinion, part of the reason why older people fall for AI propaganda is because they aren’t willing to put their own personal biases aside. You can give them facts to prove to them that the AI videos are fake, but they still double down because it’s the ideas being presented that they stand by. The article doesn’t discuss this, but I think this is an important factor to take into consideration.</p>
