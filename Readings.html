<h1>In Plato's Cave</h1>
<p>	For me, photography is a way to capture memories. Time is the one resource that we can’t get back and I like that I can preserve the moments of life that I have lived. It is also reassuring to know that I will be able to preserve the life that I still have yet to live. Sure, I always have the option of telling stories with my words, but sometimes you need a visual representation of a specific moment in time to do a story justice.</p>
<p>As each day goes by, I realize more and more that I am living through a crucial point in time. As a college student in 2025, I am experiencing my early years of adulthood and I am becoming more conscious of the world around me. I have my own stories, but so does everyone else. One thousand people can experience the same exact event, yet somehow each individual person will still have their own account of it. On one hand, this can be a beautiful and fascinating thing, but on the other hand, it can become dangerous very fast. Words can be skewed, but so can images. Pictures tell stories, but not everyone will agree on what story a picture tells. This is when photography becomes weaponized.</p>
<p>In using photography to preserve memories, I also intend to use photography to express the things that I believe to be true. In the age of social media and a rapidly expanding digital world, it has become apparent that even the truth is subjective. The way I see it, there are three sides to the truth: the first is my own perspective, the second is someone else’s perspective, and the third is what really happened. I want to use photography to tell a story that is as close as possible to what really happened. Of course, it would be impossible for one single person to tell the whole truth, since perspective tends to taint credibility. However, I will educate myself on the prior and current circumstances that occur when I take a picture. This way, I will know how to frame my pictures in a way that will portray other perspectives in addition to my own.</p>
<p> The specific things that I choose to capture are crucial to consider when trying to visually represent the notions of our world at this moment in time. The current political climate is hot, so delicacy is key when it comes to capturing it. The key is to take multiple pictures, whether it’s from articles of varying sources to capture the stories on the news or various moments from a protest, in order to show multiple perspectives from people of this time. People will always have different perspectives on politics, but there’s something else we all experience yet have different takes on: pop culture! Whether it’s fashion choices or popular food, everyone has different tastes and experiences culture differently. Pop culture is my favorite aspect of life to capture and I would love to capture as much of it as possible, even the aspects I don't necessarily participate in myself. I enjoy capturing things like outfits I wear and festivals I attend, so I can capture these sorts of things from some friends that have different tastes than me because my experience of pop culture is not representative of everyone’s experience.</p>
