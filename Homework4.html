<p>With the Bad Bunny Super Bowl Halftime Show being announced during Hispanic Heritage month, a lot of conversations have been brought on about Puerto Ricans in America. It's clear that many Americans from the states have yet to learn that Puerto Ricans are, in fact, U.S. citizens, so I wanted to create images that would reflect the fact that Puerto Ricans are treated as less than American.</p>
<p>I created the first image using both American and Puerto Rican symbols in front of an image of NYC as a reminder of Puerto Ricans' American status. In the second image, I wanted to focus Puerto Ricans receiving unfair treatment from the government, as the unjust treatment of Puerto Ricans unfortunately doesn't end with citizens. The first time  can remember seeing the government's role in Puerto Ricans being treated as lesser then was during Hurricane Maria in 2017, so I used this disaster as the basis for creating an image that represents how the government stands by and watches (and when they do give aid, it's insufficent) as Puerto Rico suffers.</p>
